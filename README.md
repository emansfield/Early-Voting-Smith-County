# Early-Voting-Smith-County
## Concatenate (smoosh together) county voting data in Python/pandas 
This is a repo I created after receiving like files from my county elections office. 
They sent them as Excel files every day of early voting. I then cleaned them in Excel beforehand, saved them as .csv files, and gave them consistent names. 
The repo uses the command line to launch jupyter notebook, which can then be run to smoosh together the files into a new .csv file. 
The notebook is annotated with what I needed to understand. 
I plan to use the file I created in this to join the early voters in R with the voter list and analyze voter turnout.
